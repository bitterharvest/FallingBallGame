# FallingBallGame
This is a simple application program using Netwire. Netwire realizes functional reactive programming using Haskell. Functional reactive programming is useful for realizing simulation, game and robot programs. As this application program is very simple but covers the essential part of Netwire, it is helpful to understand the concept of Netwire and implement more practical application programs.
